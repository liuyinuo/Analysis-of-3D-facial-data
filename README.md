Dissection of a 3D triangulated point cloud

This r function is to dissect a 3D image or a 3D triangulated point cloud along a user specified path on the surface of an object (functioning as a scissor). The outcome consists of complete triangulated pieces where the path is a part of their edges. The use of it needs the call of other functions in the package "face3d" which is lead by Professor Adrian Bowman (["face3d" package page](https://www.google.com)).
Note that the development of this function is at an early stage and only works for specific circumstance.
